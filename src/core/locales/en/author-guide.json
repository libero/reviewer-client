Leading academic researchers on our editorial board evaluate all new submissions. The editors elect to send around 30% of manuscripts, those that they believe are of the highest scientific standards and importance, to external experts for in-depth peer review. More than half of the articles that are selected for peer review are ultimately published in eLife, for an overall acceptance rate of around 16%.",
            "p2": "To increase the accessibility of research and ensure that it is communicated rapidly, we expect authors to post their research as a preprint (using preprint servers such as <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bioRxiv</a>, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">medRxiv</a> or <a href=\"https://www.authorea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Authorea</a>), either before submission to eLife or during the review process. The advantages of posting a preprint have been summarised by <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/elife-news/what-are-elife-papers-made-of\" target=\"_blank\">ASAPbio</a>. Authors can upload a preprint to <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bioRxiv</a> or <a href=\"https://www.authorea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Authorea</a> and then transfer their files directly to eLife for consideration, they can have their work transferred to <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bioRxiv</a> during the full submission process, or they can post the preprint themselves to an appropriate preprint server at any point before acceptance.",

All resulting peer reviews will be posted to bioRxiv and will independently inform a decision about whether to publish the paper in eLife.

It is also possible to submit a manuscript to eLife and then post if directly to bioRxiv or Authorea as a preprint, and vice versa.",
            "question2": "2. If I make an initial submission to eLife and a paper on a similar topic has recently been published in a peer-reviewed journal, will the other paper influence the treatment of my submission to eLife?",
            "answer2": "The Editors always take the existing literature into account when making decisions about submissions, so situations like this are dealt with on a case-by-case basis. However, eLife does not subscribe to a 'winner-takes-all' philosophy, and does not automatically reject papers because they are not 'first' (please see<a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/05770?_ga=2.156477752.2069272108.1540132848-2034406101.1537543708\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sc-gojNiO kiqxuj\">Malhotra and Marder, 2015</a> and <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/30076\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sc-gojNiO kiqxuj\">Marder, 2017</a>).",
            "question3": "3. If I make an initial submission to eLife and a preprint on a similar topic has been posted on a recognized server, will the preprint influence the evaluation of my submission to eLife?",
            "answer3": "No. However, in situations like this we would encourage you to post your initial submission as a preprint on a recognized server.",
            "question4": "4. Does eLife offer \"scoop protection\"? In other words, if I make an initial submission to eLife and a paper on a similar topic is published in another peer-reviewed journal before a decision has been made on my initial submission, will the paper in the other journal influence the evaluation of my submission to eLife?",
            "answer4": "eLife does offer \"scoop protection\" in the sense that your initial submission will not be rejected on the grounds that it lacks novelty because of the paper in the other journal. However, it is still possible that the initial submission will be rejected on other grounds.",
            "question5": "5. If I make an initial submission to eLife and a preprint on a similar topic is posted on a recognized server before a decision has been made on my initial submission, will the preprint influence the evaluation of my submission to eLife?",
            "answer5": "As in the previous case, your initial submission will not be rejected on the grounds that it lacks novelty because of the preprint. However, it is still possible that the initial submission will be rejected on other grounds.",
            "question6": "6. If I make an initial submission to eLife and a manuscript on a similar topic is already being reviewed by eLife, or has been accepted for publication by eLife, will the other manuscript influence the evaluation of my submission to eLife?",
            "answer6": "As in the previous case, your initial submission will not be rejected on the grounds that it lacks novelty because of the other manuscript. However, it is still possible that the initial submission will be rejected on other grounds.",
            "question7": "7. If my initial submission to eLife is available as a preprint and it attracts negative/critical feedback (eg, in the form of comments and/or other preprints) before a decision has been made, will this feedback influence the evaluation of my submission?",
            "answer7": "The Editors will primarily base their decision on the content of your submission, but public feedback on the work (positive or negative) might be taken into account. If a full submission is invited, you are advised to be open about the existence of such feedback in your cover letter.",
            "question8": "8. Can I cite a preprint in my submission to eLife?",
            "answer8": "Yes, providing it has been posted on a recognised public preprint server and has a persistent ID. Preprints should be cited as follows: - Author(s). Year. Title.
