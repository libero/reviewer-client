Leading academic researchers on our editorial board evaluate all new submissions. The editors elect to send around 30% of manuscripts, those that they believe are of the highest scientific standards and importance, to external experts for in-depth peer review. More than half of the articles that are selected for peer review are ultimately published in eLife, for an overall acceptance rate of around 16%.",
