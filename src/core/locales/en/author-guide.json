Leading academic researchers on our editorial board evaluate all new submissions. The editors elect to send around 30% of manuscripts, those that they believe are of the highest scientific standards and importance, to external experts for in-depth peer review. More than half of the articles that are selected for peer review are ultimately published in eLife, for an overall acceptance rate of around 16%.",

The advantages of posting a preprint have been summarised by <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/elife-news/what-are-elife-papers-made-of\" target=\"_blank\">ASAPbio</a>. Authors can upload a preprint to <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bioRxiv</a> or <a href=\"https://www.authorea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Authorea</a> and then transfer their files directly to eLife for consideration, they can have their work transferred to <a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bioRxiv</a> during the full submission process, or they can post the preprint themselves to an appropriate preprint server at any point before acceptance.",
