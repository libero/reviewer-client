        "p2": "Upon receiving the full submission, a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors will usually review the article him or herself and solicit at least one other external reviewer.",
        "p3": "An online consultation session is opened with the reviewer(s) once all the reviews have been received. The Reviewing Editor will draft a decision letter, with input welcome from the other reviewer(s). A <a href=\"http://elifesciences.org/about#leadership\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sc-gojNiO kiqxuj\">Senior Editor</a> is available at each stage to provide guidance and oversight of the process as a whole. Our aim is to provide clear and decisive instructions to authors, so that they know what they need to do to get the article published. If a revision is requested, the decision letter will usually include a single set of instructions; the full reviews in this case are not sent to the authors. Additional rounds of revision are usually eliminated, as the Reviewing Editor is able to assess most revised submissions without re-review.",
        "p4": "If the decision is that the article cannot be revised in a reasonable time frame for publication in eLife and must therefore be rejected, the letter will usually include the full reviews, with the reasons clearly explained.",

It is also a requirement to have had at least two first-author publications in an area of research within the scope of eLife.

We seek to publish all highly influential research in these fields, whereby influence is interpreted in the broadest sense to cover the advance in understanding, potential to drive a field forward, and real-world outcomes. Articles must be methodologically and scientifically rigorous, ethically conducted, and objectively presented according to the appropriate community standards."

If you want to state that something is already known, and either contradicts or duplicates a major conclusion of the manuscript, please support this with appropriate references. When writing your review, please consider these important questions and evaluate the paper as submitted:",

These principles are intended to accelerate scientific progress by promoting modes of communication whereby new results are made available quickly, penly, and in a way that helps others to build upon them.",

Reviewers are asked not make allegations of misconduct within the review itself or within the online consultation, but in the event of concerns about potential plagiarism, inappropriate image manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, reviewers should alert the journal’s editorial staff in the first instance. The editorial staff will consult the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and consider the concerns further.",

            "bullet3": "Is the paper suitable for publication in eLife as it stands, even if the paper would be stronger with additional work? In other words, are the major conclusions, with potentially minor adjustments, justified without additional experiments, analyses, or data collection? In these circumstances, we should limit requests for revision to issues of clarity and presentation.",
            "bullet4": "Do the major conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data or analyses to be fully supported? If so, we should ask the authors to alter their claims or make clear which conclusions require what additional supporting data. (Once such experiments are done, the authors can publish them on a preprint server and/or submit a Research Advance in future.) This option reflects the difficulty that many labs are currently facing in acquiring new data.",
            "bullet5": "Does the work have potential but require essential additional data to support the central claims of the paper? In these cases we should ask for revisions (without a deadline) and encourage the authors to post the paper to a preprint server along with the reviews from eLife. Please ensure that any requests for new work fall within the scope of the current submission and the technical expertise of the authors."
