        "p2": "Upon receiving the full submission, a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors will usually review the article him or herself and solicit at least one other external reviewer.",
        "p3": "An online consultation session is opened with the reviewer(s) once all the reviews have been received. The Reviewing Editor will draft a decision letter, with input welcome from the other reviewer(s). A <a href=\"http://elifesciences.org/about#leadership\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"sc-gojNiO kiqxuj\">Senior Editor</a> is available at each stage to provide guidance and oversight of the process as a whole. Our aim is to provide clear and decisive instructions to authors, so that they know what they need to do to get the article published. If a revision is requested, the decision letter will usually include a single set of instructions; the full reviews in this case are not sent to the authors. Additional rounds of revision are usually eliminated, as the Reviewing Editor is able to assess most revised submissions without re-review.",
