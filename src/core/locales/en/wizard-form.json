One of the groups we need to share your data with is our international editors, guest editors, and potentially peer reviewers. Since they are carrying out their roles as individuals, it is impracticable for us to have such comprehensive contractual protection for your data with them as we have with other third parties. This means that your personal data is unlikely to have the same level of protection as it would if those editors and guest reviewers were based in the UK. Because of this risk, we ask for your explicit consent to share your personal data with them, which you can withdraw at any time (by emailing <a href=\"mailto:data@elifesciences.org\">data@elifesciences.org</a>). Please enter your name and check the box below to give this consent. Without this consent we will not be able to evaluate your submission.",
