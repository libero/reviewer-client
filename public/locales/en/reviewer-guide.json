To facilitate the use of this information in our peer-review process, we make our editors and reviewers aware of relevant commentary to factor into their assessment as they deem appropriate. Currently we include publicly available reviews made available via <a href=\"https://sciety.org\" target=\"_blank\">Sciety</a> or Transparent Review in Preprints (<a href=\"https://connect.biorxiv.org/news/2021/05/14/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">TRiP</a>), public comments accompanying the preprint itself, and comments made on the preprint at <a href=\"https://pubpeer.com/static/about\" target=\"_blank\">PubPeer</a>.</p><p class=\"paragraph typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The guidelines below are most relevant to reviews of Research Articles, Short Reports, Tools and Resources, and Research Advances.

Reviewers retain copyright of the public review and consent to eLife publishing the public review using a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Public Domain Dedication</a>, which allows the review to be freely reused by anyone for any purpose.

During the consultation session the group discusses the paper’s strengths and weaknesses, and an effort is made to resolve any areas of disagreement and arrive at a consensus decision as to whether the paper is suitable for publication in eLife.</p><h3 class=\"typography__heading typography__heading--h3\">Papers receiving a revise decision</h3><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">If the paper is deemed suitable for eLife, the Reviewing Editor drafts a decision letter, in consultation with the reviewers, that enumerates the issues that the authors must address in a revision before publication. This will be sent to the authors, along with the public portion of each review and any remaining recommendations from the reviews not addressed in the decision.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">If the authors decide to proceed with a revision, we will post the public portions of each review alongside the preprint, and on our <a href=\"https://sciety.org\" target=\"_blank\">sciety</a> platform, unless authors ask for them to be postponed until publication, either at eLife or elsewhere.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Once a revision is received, the Reviewing Editor will determine, following consultation with the original reviewers if they deem it necessary, if the authors have addressed the issues raised in the review. When they have, the paper will be formally accepted for publication by eLife. It will enter into our normal production process, and the preprint will be updated to indicate that the paper has been accepted with a link to the published version.</p><h3 class=\"typography__heading typography__heading--h3\">Papers we decline to publish</h3><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">If the reviewers decide that the paper is not appropriate for eLife, the Reviewing Editor drafts a decision letter in consultation with the reviewers that explains the reasons for rejection: this letter will also include the public reviews and detailed feedback from each reviewer. We hope and expect that many authors whose papers are rejected will nonetheless find the reviews constructive and suitable for posting alongside their preprint. Because these public reviews will be posted under the eLife banner, they can be used directly by other journals as the basis for their own publishing decisions. We are also happy to share the detailed feedback and reviewer names (where they agree) with other journals.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">However, we realize that some authors may be reluctant to participate in a system that they fear might compromise their ability to get their work published if it is not accepted by eLife. We will therefore give authors the option to delay posting our reviews until their paper has been accepted for publication in another journal. Because all reviews will ultimately be publicly posted, we hope that most authors will be motivated to address the concerns raised during eLife’s review process before it is published.</p>"

Thus all public reviews posted to preprints will be signed by eLife and not by individuals, putting the onus on us as an organization and community to ensure that our reviews are of the highest quality and ethics.

Assessment (between two and four sentences)</h3><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">This is a very short summary of the reviewer’s assessment of the work and its likely impact in the field, outside the field, or in society. This assessment should be easily readable by non-experts, and should clearly convey the judgment of the reviewer about whether the papers’ primary claims are supported by the data, and to whom the manuscript will be of interest or use. The assessment should not repeat the abstract of the paper, it should be easily readable by non-experts, and it should not use field-specific jargon or abbreviations.</p><p>In one or two sentences, please summarise the <strong>significance of the findings</strong> and the <strong>strength of the evidence</strong> presented in support of them, using using the most appropriate terms and some of the phrases below (edited as needed):</p>Describing the <strong>significance of the findings:</strong><ul><li><strong>Landmark:</strong> findings with profound implications that are expected to have widespread influence</li><li><strong>Fundamental:</strong> findings that substantially advance our understanding of major research questions</li><li><strong>Important:</strong> findings that have theoretical or practical implications beyond a single subfield</li><li><strong>Valuable:</strong> findings that have theoretical or practical implications for a subfield</li><li><strong>Useful:</strong> findings that have focused importance and scope</li></ul><p>Describing the <strong>strength of evidence:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Exceptional:</strong> exemplary use of existing approaches that establish new standards for a field</li><li><strong>Compelling:</strong> evidence that features methods, data and analyses more rigorous than the current state of the art</li><li><strong>Convincing:</strong> appropriate and validated methodology in line with current state-of-the-art</li><li><strong>Solid:</strong> methods, data and analyses broadly support the claims with only minor weaknesses</li><li><strong>Incomplete:</strong> main claims are only partially supported</li><li><strong>Inadequate:</strong> methods, data and analyses do not support the primary claims</li></ul><p>As part of the review consultation, the Reviewing Editor will compose a single eLife assessment that the authors could include on a CV or a job or grant application as an independent, external assessment of the impact of their work.</p><p>A series of example eLife assessments follow:</p><ul><li>This <strong>fundamental</strong> work substantially advances our understanding of protein import into peroxisomes by identifying a novel player in this process and uncovering its mode of action. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <strong>compelling</strong>, with rigorous biochemical assays and state-of-the-art microscopy. The work will be of broad interest to cell biologists and biochemists.</li><li>This study presents a <strong>valuable</strong> finding on the increased activity of two well-studied signal transduction pathways in a specific subtype of breast cancer. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <strong>solid</strong>, although inclusion of a larger number of patient samples and an animal model would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to medical biologists working on breast cancer.</li><li>This <strong>important</strong> study combines experiments and theory to quantify the force exerted on chromosomes during cell division. The new method for force measurements is highly <strong>compelling</strong> and goes beyond the current state of the art, but the theoretical analysis is <strong>incomplete</strong> and would benefit from more rigorous approaches. With the theoretical part strengthened, this paper would be of interest to cell biologists and biophysicists working on the cytoskeleton and cell division.</li><li>This study presents a <strong>useful</strong> inventory of genes that are up- and down regulated in human heart tissue during aging. The data were collected and analyzed using <strong>solid</strong> and validated methodology and can be used as a starting point for functional studies of heart development and disease.</li><li>This paper reports the <strong>fundamental</strong> discovery of a new mode of mammalian cell migration, which does not involve either actin or microtubule cytoskeleton. If confirmed, the study will change the way we think about cell motility and would be of very broad general interest. However, whereas some of the imaging data are <strong>compelling</strong>, the functional analyses are <strong>inadequate</strong> as they rely on a very limited set of pharmacological treatments.</li><li>This <strong>landmark</strong> study provides a comprehensive morphological and molecular description of the majority of documented neuronal cell types in the mouse cortex. This provides an extraordinary resource that will be invaluable to the whole neuroscience community. The methodology for combining expansion microscopy with spatially resolved transcriptomics across tissues is <strong>exceptional</strong> and establishes a new standard in the field.</li></ul><h3>2. Public Review</h3><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The public review, which will be posted alongside the manuscript on the preprint server where it resides, is the main section of our review. It contains the detailed assessment of the reviewer of the work, written primarily for others reading the paper or considering using its methods, data or conclusions.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Our goal is not simply to take existing peer reviews and post them online. Rather we want to change how we construct and write peer reviews to make them useful to both authors and readers in a way that better reflects the work you as a reviewer put into reading and thinking about a paper.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">We expect the bulk of a reviewers' thoughts and judgment about a paper will be in the public review, with only specific types of comments reserved for private correspondence with the authors.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">We recommend that public reviews contain:</p><ul class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><li>A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</li><li>An account of the major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results.</li><li>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions.</li><li>A discussion of the likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community.</li><li>Any additional context you think would help readers interpret or understand the significance of the work.</li></ul><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The public nature of these reviews means that they:</p><ul class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><li>Should be clear about any technical and conceptual concerns, but should also be written in a serious and constructive manner appropriate for a public audience, and mindful of the impact language choices might have on the authors.</li><li>Address the entire paper, not just individual points or sections.</li><li>Highlight how and where the authors succeeded, where there are useful data, and where there are major conceptual and technical advances.</li></ul><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The public review is an assessment of the manuscript in its current form, and is independent of any particular publishing decision. They should therefore not include:</p><ul class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><li>Comments on the appropriateness of the manuscript for publication in eLife or speculation about where it should be published.</li><li>Suggestions on how to improve the science or the manuscript, especially those directed at increasing its impact, except where they help to convey points raised in the review to readers.</li><li>Open-ended questions.</li><li>Discussion of minor points or issues of presentation except where they may lead to confusion about the major points of the paper.</li></ul><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Examples of public reviews can be found below. Please note that we may lightly edit the reviews for tone and consistency prior to posting.</p><h3>3. Recommendations for the authors</h3><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Although most aspects of a reviewer’s assessment belong in the public review, we reserve some types of comments and queries for a private set of recommendations to the authors, which will be communicated separately to the authors, editor and other reviewers.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">This section should include:</p><ul class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><li>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data or analyses, especially those directed at increasing the impact of the work and making it suitable for eLife.</li><li>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</li><li>Minor corrections to the text and figures.</li></ul><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Information that is in the public review should not be repeated here. For example, as a general rule, concerns about a claim not being justified by the data should be explained in the public review, while specific suggestions for how the authors might address these concerns should be placed here.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">However, we recognize that in some cases the best way to explain perceived flaws in an experiment or analysis is to suggest a better one, and in such cases the recommendation should be in the public review. Similarly, if there are issues of writing and presentation that are likely to lead to confusion or the drawing of incorrect conclusions by readers, these should be raised in the public review.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">This section should also list any issues the authors need to address about the availability of data, code, reagents, research ethics, or other issues pertaining to the adherence of the manuscript to eLife’s publishing policies.</p>",

                "content": "<p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Serra-Marques, Martin et al. investigated the individual and cooperative roles of specific kinesins in transporting Rab6 secretory vesicles in HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas knockouts and live-cell imaging. They find that both kinesin-1 KIF5B and kinesin-3 KIF13B cooperate in transporting Rab6 vesicles, but Eg5 and other kinesin-3s (KIF1B and KIF1C) are dispensable for Rab6 vesicle transport. They show that both KIF5B and KIF13B localize to these vesicles and coordinate their activities such that KIF5B is the main driver of the cargos on older, MAP7-decorated microtubules, and KIF13B takes over as the main transporter on freshly-polymerized microtubule ends that are largely devoid of MAP7. Interestingly, the data also indicate that KIF5B is important for controlling Rab6 vesicle size, which KIF13B cannot rescue. By performing  a technically impressive analysis of the the motor distribution on vesicle with subpixel resolution, the authors find that the motors localize to the front of the vesicle when driving transport, but upon directional cargo switching, KIF5B but not KIF13B localizes to the back of the vesicle when opposing dynein.These data add in an interesting way to the ongoing discussion on whether motors of opposite polarity present on the same cargo engage in a tug-of-war.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">1) The metrics used to quantify motility are sensitive to tracking errors and uncertainty. The authors quantify the number of runs (Figure 2D,F; 7C) and the average speed (Figure 3A,B,D,E,H). The number of runs is sensitive to linking errors in tracking. A single, long trajectory is often misrepresented as multiple shorter trajectories. These linking errors are sensitive to small differences in the signal-to-noise ratio between experiments and conditions, and the set of tracking parameters used. The average speed is reported only for the long, processive runs (tracks>20 frames, segments<6 frames with velocity vector correlation >0.6). For many vesicular cargoes, these long runs represent <10% of the total motility. In the 4X-KO cells, it is expected there is very little processive motility, yet the average speed is higher than in control cells. Frame-to-frame velocities are often overestimated due to the tracking uncertainty. To make their results more solid, the authors should have used additional metrics of vesicle motility. For example, they could have used metrics such as mean-squared displacement, which are less sensitive to tracking errors. The authors should have also provided either the average velocity of the entire run (including pauses), or the fraction of time represented by the processive segments to aid in interpreting the velocity data.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">2) Adding control experiments to assess crosstalk between fluorescence images would be needed to increase confidence in the presented colocalization results.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">3) The data on KIF13B-380 motility presented in Figure 8G is not sufficiently convincing. The tracks for KIF13B-380 motility are difficult to see, which is surprising as KIF13B has been shown to be a super-processive motor. Better data would have helped to substantiate the authors’ conclusions.</p>"

                "content": "<p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">This work provides a new general tool for measuring rapid sequences of patterns in neural activity.  Such sequences have been studied in the activity of cells in rodent hippocampus for decades (termed replay). They are suggested substrates for a number of important cognitive functions including memory consolidation, mental simulation and planning. Recently it has become possible to detect such sequences in humans using MEG and fMRI. This paper provides a modelling and inference framework for detecting such sequences from all types of data using the same approach.  It should therefore allow replay to be compared more directly across species.  It is also a more general technique than those typically used in rodents, so it may allow rigorous replay measurements in situations that are not currently possible.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Strengths:</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Placing sequence analysis into a General linear modelling framework enables a powerful set of established tools for hypothesis testing and inference to be brought to bear on the analysis of sequences. Hypotheses about sequences can be formally expressed as regressors in a linear model. Standard tools can then be used for parametric or non-parametric inference. It allows formal approaches to address issues such as serial autocorrelations in the data, to ensure that inference is unbiased.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Because the regressors are built out of transitions from a graph, the technique is in principle amenable to measuring sequences in any situation where experiences can be expressed as a graph. This contrasts with other approaches that, for example, can only be used for rodents running along a linear track, but not in a maze or an open 2D environment. This generality in principle allows replay measurements in situations where other published techniques do not, and allows the same tools to be used to describe replay in many different situations, potentially allowing comparisons across different situations.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The technique in principle works in the same way across many different types of data giving the potential to compare more directly replay across different species where very different types of data has been acquired.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Weaknesses:</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Although the paper does have strengths in principle, the weaknesses of the paper are that these strengths are not directly demonstrated. That is, insufficient analyses are performed to fully support the key claims in the manuscript by the data presented. In particular:</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The authors imply the current method is superior to other methods on various different dimensions but there is very little actual comparison with other methods to substantiate this claim, particularly for sequences of more than two states which have been extensively used in the rodent replay literature (see Tingley and Peyrache, Proc Royal Soc B 2020 for a recent review of the rodent methods; different shuffling procedures are applied to identify sequenceness, see e.g., Farooq et al. Neuron 2019 and Foster, Ann Rev Neurosci 2017).</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The authors claim that the method is more general than other methods on various different dimensions (ability to apply to different kinds of graphs; ability to apply to different species), but again the data supporting this claim is sparse. The method is not applied rigorously to graphs with different structure or from different species. Instead, it is applied to two MEG experiments with the same structure (linear-4 elements), and there is a small section that is very hard to understand where it is applied to rodent ePhys data. It is therefore very difficult to assess these claims.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The inference part of the work is potentially very valuable because this is an area that has been well studied in GLM/multiple regression type problems. However, the authors limit themselves to asking \"first-order\" sequence questions (i.e., whether observed sequenceness is different from random) when key questions, including whether or not there is evidence of replay, are actually \"second-order\" questions because they require a comparison of sequences across two conditions (e.g., pre-task and post-task; I'm borrowing this terminology from van der Meer et al. Proc Royal Soc B 2020). The authors do not address how to make this kind of comparison using their method.</p>"
