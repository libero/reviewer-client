        "content": "<p class=\"paragraph typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">In the author guide we provide an overview of the <a href=\"https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#process\" target=\"_blank\">editorial process</a>, including how we identify the submissions that are appropriate for in-depth peer review.</p><p class=\"paragraph typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">To help change how publishing works, eLife believes that clear, transparent public reviews – independently of whether a manuscript will be accepted for publication in eLife – should be the central mechanism by which research is evaluated. Because of this, reviewing at eLife is different from other journals. In particular, the review is structured in several distinct sections that have different purposes, including ones that should be written for publication.</p><p class=\"paragraph typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The primary goal of the editorial process is to produce a set of public reviews that are designed to be posted, along with the paper, to a preprint server. These public reviews include guidance for readers around how to interpret the work, and they should be written for readers, potential readers and others interested in the results of peer review, as well as for the authors. Authors control whether the reviews are posted publicly, so please frame your comments constructively and with a public readership in mind.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The reviews will also serve as the basis for the decision about the future of the paper at eLife. Once all the reviews have been received, you will be invited to discuss your comments with the other reviewers in an online consultation session, in which the reviewers will be identified to one another, and you can recommend whether the paper should be revised for publication by eLife or rejected. Additional experiments, analyses, or data collection should only be requested if they are essential.</p>",

(eLife requires all datasets associated with an article to be made freely and widely available, unless there are strong reasons to restrict access, for example in the case of human subjects data.)</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">Finally, we welcome comments on the extent and appropriateness of the statistical information provided. (Authors should provide information about data processing and analysis, including any statistical tests applied, with exact sample number, p values of tests, criteria for data inclusion or exclusion, and details of replicates.)</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">When writing your recommendations for the authors, please consider these questions:</p><ul class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><li>Does the work warrant publication in eLife in principle?</li><li>If the current conclusions warrant publication in eLife, but are not fully supported by the existing data, can this be easily addressed? If not, the submission should be rejected.</li><li>Is the paper suitable for publication in eLife as it stands, even if the paper would be stronger with additional work? In other words, are the major conclusions, with potentially minor adjustments, justified without additional experiments, analyses, or data collection? In these circumstances, we should limit requests for revision to issues of clarity and presentation.</li><li>Do the major conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data or analyses to be fully supported? If so, we should ask the authors to alter their claims or make clear which conclusions require what additional supporting data. (Once such experiments are done, the authors can publish them on a preprint server and/or submit a Research Advance in future.) This option reflects the difficulty that many labs are currently facing in acquiring new data.</li><li>Does the work have potential but require essential additional data to support the central claims of the paper? In these cases we should ask for revisions (without a deadline) and encourage the authors to post the paper to a preprint server along with the reviews from eLife. Please ensure that any requests for new work fall within the scope of the current submission and the technical expertise of the authors.</li></ul><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">If you want to state that something is already known, and either contradicts or duplicates a major conclusion of the manuscript, please support this with appropriate references.</p>"

            "content": "<p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">We hope that evaluation summaries will serve two purposes. First, they will provide a concise guide as to whether a reader should be interested in reading the paper. Second, they should provide an evaluation that authors can use, for example in tenure evaluations, job searches, or grant applications. It is nevertheless important to be concise, as its purpose is to guide the attention and decisions of busy people, and to be constructive.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><strong>Example 1:</strong> This paper will be of interest to scientists across systems neuroscience and has high clinical relevance. It reveals a novel circuit mechanism underlying impulsive behaviour. A series of compelling experimental manipulations dissect the circuit. They conclusively support the key claims in the paper.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><strong>Example 2:</strong> This paper will be of interest to the large class of neuroscientists who perform extracellular electrophysiology. It sets a new standard for automatically separating signals from different cells, and is therefore likely to be taken up broadly by the field. It performs extensive comparisons against the existing state of the art that support the major claims of the paper.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><strong>Example 3:</strong> The premise behind this manuscript is important and timely both for auditory neuroscientists and for informing technology. The data support the conclusions of the manuscript within the current context, but do not yet support generalising the conclusions to related contexts, such as other auditory stimuli or more naturalistic listening conditions.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><strong>Example 4:</strong> This paper will be of interest to cognitive neuroscientists who perform subsequent memory experiments with fMRI. It provides useful technical advice for the analysis of such data. The key claims of the manuscript are well supported by the data, and the approaches used are thoughtful and rigorous.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><strong>Example 5:</strong> This paper is of potential interest to a broad audience of neuroscientists, as it implies a major adjustment to our current understanding of cortical circuitry. The data quality is unusually high. However, reasonable alternative explanations can be identified such that the data do not strongly favor the preferred hypothesis put forward by the authors.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\"><strong>Example 6:</strong> This paper is of interest to scientists within the field of motor control. The data analysis is rigorous and the conclusions are justified by the data. The key claims of the manuscript are directly related to, and support, previous known findings.</p>"
