Because of this, reviewing at eLife is different from other journals. In particular, the review is structured in several distinct sections that have different purposes, including ones that should be written for publication.</p><p class=\"paragraph typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The primary goal of the editorial process is to produce a set of public reviews that are designed to be posted, along with the paper, to a preprint server. These public reviews include guidance for readers around how to interpret the work, and they should be written for readers, potential readers and others interested in the results of peer review, as well as for the authors. Authors control whether the reviews are posted publicly, so please frame your comments constructively and with a public readership in mind.</p><p class=\"typography__serif typography__serif--primary\">The reviews will also serve as the basis for the decision about the future of the paper at eLife. Once all the reviews have been received, you will be invited to discuss your comments with the other reviewers in an online consultation session, in which the reviewers will be identified to one another, and you can recommend whether the paper should be revised for publication by eLife or rejected. Additional experiments, analyses, or data collection should only be requested if they are essential.</p>",
