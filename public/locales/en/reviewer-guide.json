The Reviewing Editor will draft a decision letter, with input welcome from the other reviewer(s). A <a href=\"http://elifesciences.org/about#leadership\" target=\"_blank\">Senior Editor</a> is available at each stage to provide guidance and oversight of the process as a whole. Our aim is to provide clear and decisive instructions to authors, so that they know what they need to do to get the article published. If a revision is requested, the decision letter will usually include a single set of instructions; the full reviews in this case are not sent to the authors. Additional rounds of revision are usually eliminated, as the Reviewing Editor is able to assess most revised submissions without re-review.",

We seek to publish all highly influential research in these fields, whereby influence is interpreted in the broadest sense to cover the advance in understanding, potential to drive a field forward, and real-world outcomes.

In other words, are the major conclusions, with potentially minor adjustments, justified without additional experiments, analyses, or data collection? In these circumstances, we should limit requests for revision to issues of clarity and presentation.",

If so, we should ask the authors to alter their claims or make clear which conclusions require what additional supporting data.

This option reflects the difficulty that many labs are currently facing in acquiring new data.",

In these cases we should ask for revisions (without a deadline) and encourage the authors to post the paper to a preprint server along with the reviews from eLife.

To provide accountability and appropriate credit, the name of the co-referee should be disclosed to the editors in advance and we would encourage all reviewers to consider sharing their names with the authors. The two co-reviewers should agree on the wording of the review, and the same principles relating to confidentiality and competing interests apply to both reviewers.
